        <h3>Rheinmetall-Denel Munition</h3>
        <h4>Project Manager/Development Manger: 2014-Present</h4>
        <p>Rheinmetall-Denel Munition provides me with the opportunity to oversee and manage development projects from initiation to closing. To date I have completed several large projects and I am currently managing multiple projects in parallel. It is here where I learnt to effectively manage stakeholder expecations as well as identify and mitigate potential project risk factors. </p>

        <h3>Kansai Plascon</h3>
        <h4>Project Coordinator: 2013-2014</h4>
        <p>Plascon was my first taste of a corporate environment. I learnt a lot about work ethic and the social dynamic that the working environment presents. From my experience at Kansai Plascon, I learnt that being able to effectively manage relationships with colleagues was key to succesfully achieving objectives.</p>

        <h4>Teaching assistant/Tutor: 2008-2012</h4>

        <h3>Project Management Institute</h3>
        <h4>Project Management Profesional (PMP): 2019</h4>
        <p>Pursuing the PMP certification improved my understanding of project management framework fundamentals as well as best practice techniques. I was able to identify bad habits that I had developed and was subsequently able to correct them accordingly. The
          PMP framework significantly improved my ability to function effectively as a project manager.</p>

        <h3>Regent Business School</h3>
        <h4>Master of Business Administration (MBA): 2019</h4>
        <p>I was really fascinated by how businesses operate and wanted to understand the fundamentals of what characterises a succesful business. I was amazed by the complexities that exist within the business landspace and realised that there is definitley no
          "one-size-fits-all" solution. A clear vision and understanding of these complexities is required in order to navigate through all the volatility and uncertainty to succeed.</p>

        <h3>University of Cape Town</h3>
        <h4>Master of Science (MSc): 2011</h4>
        <p>Ever since seeing Bill Nye "The Science Guy" on TV, I have always been fascinated with technology and science. My dream was to invent something that would benefit humanity, however when I grew up I realised how difficult that would really be.
          Nevertheless I try and learn new things every day and attempt to implement these things effectively in my life which includes my career.</p>
